I would like to reiterate and expound upon my request of last week for 
information about NBO 3.0.

The program I am looking for is NBO 3.0 (Natural Bond Orbital / Natural 
Population Analysis / Natural Localized Molecular Orbital Programs )
authored by Glendening, Reed, Carpenter and Weinhold.  I have been using
this program as it is supplied as an undocumented feature in Gaussian 90
and would like to able to implement it with Ampac.
   I would appreciate any information as to how I can obtain this program.

Here is the response I recieved from Frank Weinhold re: NBO

* The program NBO 3.0 and printed documentation are available through the
* Quantum Chemistry Program Exchange at Indiana University, Bloomington.  
* The program manual describes the standard interface to Ampac.
*
* We also maintain a source program (.SRC code) of the latest available
* version on the GUEST account (password: JOYRIDE) of our VAX/VMS machine
* (node 128.104.26.10) for Telnet access.  You can log into this
* account, change to the [.NBO] directory, and retrieve the files there,
* including the basic NBO.SRC program, the ENABLE.FOR "activator" (e.g., to 
* generate the AMPNBO.FOR Ampac version from NBO.SRC), and the TechSet form
* of the program manual (the TechSet formatter is available through
* ACS Software at 202-872-4378).  
*
* Andrew Holder at the Chemistry Department of the University of Missouri, 
* Kansas City, is planning to market a version of the Dewar programs which
* includes NBO, so this is a third alternative you may consider.

Thanks to those who replied to my query.
